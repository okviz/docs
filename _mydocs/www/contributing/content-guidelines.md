These editorial guidelines ensure that all content published on OKVIZ, including reviews, comparisons, and use cases of Power BI visuals, maintains a high standard of quality and consistency, providing unbiased and valuable insights.

## Types of Content

The OKVIZ content is intended for Power BI end-users, developers, data professionals, and business intelligence experts looking for the right visuals to enhance their reports. 

The following types of content are accepted:

- **Reviews:** Detailed evaluations of individual Power BI visuals. [Guidelines for Reviews](./review-guidelines/index.md).
- **Comparisons:** Side-by-side assessments of two or more visuals to help users choose the best option. [Guidelines for Comparisons](./comparison-guidelines.md).
- **Use Cases:** Practical examples of how to use a visual to solve a problem in a specific scenario. [Guidelines for Use Cases](./use-case-guidelines.md).
- **Documentation:** Detailed guides on how to use a visual, including setup, configuration, and best practices.

### Media

Content could include a variety of media to enhance the user experience and provide a comprehensive overview of the visual.

- **Screenshots:** 
    Screenshot included in the content must be high-quality images suitable for 4K screens, in PNG (recommended for UI) or JPEG format (recommended for pictures including photos). Optimize images using tools like [tinypng.com](https://tinypng.com/).

    See [Screenshots Best Practices](./screenshots.md) for more information.

- **Screencasts:**  
   If you need to record a quick demonstration of a feature, provide a small MP4 video (no longer than 10 seconds) without audio. Do not use GIFs.
   
- **Other Images:**  
   Other images such as diagrams, AI-generated images, can be included as long as you hold the rights to these images. However, we reserve the right to remove or reject any images that do not align with our website’s style or for any other reason at our discretion.

- **Videos:** 
    Videos should be provided as MP4 screencasts, with a maximum length of 5 minutes and no audio. The screencasts must demonstrate key aspects of the visuals and clearly display cursor movements and keystrokes. Optional captions can be included for text-to-speech conversion.
   > **IMPORTANT**: Do not include any personal footage, such as your face, in the videos. The screencast should solely focus on the visual and its usage within Power BI.

### Links

When including links in your content, follow these guidelines:

- Include links to relevant Power BI documentation or OKVIZ webpages where applicable. 
- **Do not provide direct links to other external websites**. Links to vendor website or documentation are automatically added when needed, so avoid including them in the content.

### Bugs

Avoid talking about bugs in your content unless the visual being evaluated is heavily buggy. Bugs are usually fixed over time and may not represent the long-term quality of the visual.

### Style and Grammar

When creating content for OKVIZ, follow these guidelines to ensure consistency and quality:

- **Best Practices:**
    - Use headings, bullet points, and numbered lists to improve readability.
    - Break down complex information into smaller sections for easier comprehension.
    - Use bold text for emphasis, but avoid overusing it.

- **Language Use:**
    - Be concise, clear, and objective. 
    - Use formal language without contractions or colloquialisms.
    - Avoid marketing language.

- **Grammar Rules:**
    - Adhere to American English grammar, punctuation, and spelling conventions. 
    - Avoid first-person language (e.g., “I think”), and instead use third-person (e.g., “the visual performs well”). 
    - Use non-abbreviated forms of words (e.g., "do not" instead of "don't"). 
    
- **Terminology:**
    - Use the term “Power BI”, "Semantic Model", and "Fabric" throughout the content.
    - Always refer to custom visuals as "visual" or "custom visual." Avoid using terms like "plugin", "component" or "view".
    - Use the terms as they are defined in the [glossary](../../visuals/glossary.md).

## AI Usage

AI tools can be used to assist in drafting, editing, or optimizing the content. However, the visuals must be genuinely used and tested by you to ensure the insights reflect real experience.
>> AI-generated content must not replace hands-on experience with the visuals. You are responsible for the accuracy of the content and ensuring that the content aligns with the guidelines. Any AI-generated content must be fact-checked and edited to meet the quality standards of the content. 

The OKVIZ website features some AI-generated content, which is always clearly labeled. These guidelines apply exclusively to content created by human contributors.

## Fact-Checking and Originality

Before submitting content, ensure that it meets the following criteria:

- **Accuracy:** Ensure that all information is verified and reflects real-world experience.
- **Originality:** Content must be original and not published elsewhere.

## Sponsored Content

All content must remain unbiased, even if sponsored. Sponsorship should not influence the evaluation or outcome. **It is not necessary to state that content is sponsored**, as this information will be included automatically.

## Editorial Process

Content can be submitted in **Markdown format** (recommended) or **Microsoft Word**. 

The editorial process includes the following steps:

- **Editing:** Content will undergo editing for style, clarity, and factual accuracy. We may also make minor adjustments to improve readability.

- **Video Editing:** If a video is provided, it will be edited into a finalized video using text-to-speech narration. You should only submit raw screencasts with optional captions.

## Maintenance

Content may be periodically updated to reflect significant changes in the visuals reviewed or compared, or enhancements to documentation and support. However, any updates must be agreed upon and carried out by the original author of the content. The author is responsible for revisiting the visuals, reassessing it based on the updated criteria, and making any necessary changes to the content.
