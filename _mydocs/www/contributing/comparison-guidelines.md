These editorial guidelines ensure that comparisons of Power BI custom visuals published on OKVIZ provide clear, unbiased, and practical insights to help users make informed decisions.

## Mission and Values

Your goal is to provide honest, objective, and detailed comparisons of Power BI visuals, considering different parameters that matter to end-users and developers, and **identifying the best visual for specific scenarios**. While pricing and other external factors can be considered, they should not overshadow the quality and functionality of the visuals themselves. 

The core values are:

- **Honesty:** Present a fair assessment of each visual's strengths and weaknesses based on actual usage.
- **Objectivity:** Evaluate visuals without bias, including details on pricing only as one of many factors.
- **Transparency:** Clearly explain how each visual performs across different parameters.

## Types of Comparisons

There are three main types of comparisons:
- **Single Visual Comparison:** Compare a custom visual with a built-in Power BI visual or another custom visual.
- **Multiple Visuals Comparison:** Compare two or more custom visuals to identify the best option for specific scenarios.
- **Chart Type Comparison:** Compare visuals within a specific chart type, such as bar charts or maps, to determine the best visual for that category.

## Parameters for Comparison

When comparing visuals, consider the following parameters:

- **Features:** Evaluate the range and quality of features offered by each visual.
- **Design:** Assess the appearance, usability, and overall visual quality. Performance can also be included here.
- **Support:** Consider the quality of documentation, community support, and vendor responsiveness.
- **Price:** Discuss the cost of each visual, including free options if available.
- **Special Factors:** This section can include factors such as the developer's reputation, roadmap expectations, or other distinctive features that may impact the user's choice.

> Note that the comparison rating may differ from the individual visual ratings since additional factors like price or special factors can influence the overall recommendation.

## Comparison Structure
Each comparison must be structured as follows:

1. **Overview:**  
   Provide a brief overview of the visuals being compared and the reason for the comparison. Mention if there are built-in alternatives in Power BI.

2. **Detailed Comparison:**  
   Present a side-by-side comparison for each parameter, highlighting which visual is best for each category. Include the rationale behind the decision.

3. **Built-in Visual Comparison** (if applicable): 
   If the visuals belong to a chart type with a built-in Power BI alternative, discuss how each custom visual compares to the built-in option.

4. **Best Visual**:  
   Summarize the comparison by identifying the best visual for most users based on the parameters evaluated.

5. **Best Free Alternative** (if available):
    If a free alternative is available, highlight it as the best choice for users seeking a no-cost solution.
    > Include this section only if the comparison involves more than two visuals.

6. **Conclusion:**  
   Summarize the comparison and provide a final recommendation based on the parameters evaluated.
