These guidelines ensure that use cases for Power BI custom visuals published on OKVIZ provide practical, high-quality insights that demonstrate how visuals can be applied to specific real-world scenarios. The goal is to help users understand the potential applications of visuals in addressing targeted business needs.

## Use Case Structure

Each use case should be structured as follows:

1. **Introduction**  

   Clearly state the problem or business scenario that the use case addresses. The problem should be specific and relevant to a particular audience or industry (e.g., "How to visualize dental health issues in a population for dental clinics?"). Avoid generic descriptions.

2. **Proposed Solution**  

   Describe how a specific custom visual can be used to solve the identified problem. Explain why this visual is a suitable choice and outline the general approach for implementing the solution.

3. **Implementation**  
   Show how the visual is applied in practice. This section should provide a high-level overview of the steps taken, including setting up the data and configuring the visual to achieve the desired outcome. Include any important considerations or limitations.

4. **Conclusion**  

   Summarize the results and benefits of using the visual for the specified use case. Discuss how it addresses the original problem and any key takeaways for the reader.

5. **In-Depth (Optional)**  

   For those interested in the technical details, include an "In-Depth" section. This should cover more specific aspects, such as how the data model was prepared, advanced configurations, and any customizations applied to the visual.

## Content Guidelines

Please refer to the **OKVIZ Content Guidelines** for shared principles, including:

Also, follow these additional guidelines:

- **Screenshots:**  
   - Include a screenshot of the intended outcome (e.g., an example from another technology, a real-world equivalent, or a conceptual image).  
   - Provide at least one screenshot of the visual in use, showcasing the final result.  
   - If possible, add another screenshot illustrating the process (e.g., an intermediate step or data preparation).  

- **Content Style:**
    - The use case should be written at a high level, aimed at business professionals and data enthusiasts.  
    - **This is NOT a tutorial**; focus on the application rather than step-by-step instructions.  
    - Avoid technical jargon unless it is essential for clarity.
