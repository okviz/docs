Here is a list of visual types and categories used by OKVIZ to classify Power BI visuals. These classifications should help you determine the appropriate features and design elements to evaluate when reviewing a visual. 

## Visual Types

Types are the primary classification for visuals. Each visual type has specific features and design elements that should be considered during the review process. 

> The visual types **are grouped based on their inherent structural components**, rather than their intended purposes.

### Cartesian Charts
Utilize X and Y axes to plot data points. Components often include axes, gridlines, data points, lines, or bars.

- 3D Bar Chart
- 3D Bubble/Scatter Chart
- Area Chart
- Bar Chart
- Beeswarm Chart
- Box & Whisker Plot
- Bubble/Scatter Chart
- Bullet Chart
- Bump Chart
- Candlestick Chart
- Combo Chart
- Density Plot
- Dot Plot
- Dumbbell Chart
- Fan Chart
- Histogram
- Likert Scale Chart
- Line Chart
- Lollipop Chart
- Marimekko Chart
- Pareto Chart
- Pictogram Chart
- Point & Figure Chart
- Population Pyramid
- Ribbon Chart
- Stream Chart
- Tornado Diagram
- Violin Plot
- Voronoi Diagram
- Waterfall Chart

### Cartesian Charts (Axis-Free)
Plot data points without traditional X and Y axes.

- Joy Plot
- Sparklines

### Polar Charts
Display data in a circular format, using radial and angular axes.

- 3D Pie Chart
- Donut Chart
- Pie Chart
- Polar Area Chart
- Radar Chart
- Radial Bar Chart
- Spiral Plot

### Network Charts
Consist of nodes (data points) connected by links (relationships). Components include nodes, edges, and labels.

- Arc Diagram
- Chord Diagram
- Network Diagram
- Parallel Coordinates Plot
- Sankey Diagram

### Process and Flow Charts
Illustrate steps or stages in a process. Components include flow lines, stages, and decision points.

- Bowtie Chart
- Flow Chart
- Funnel Chart

### Hierarchical Charts
Represent data with parent-child relationships. Components include nodes, branches, and hierarchical levels.

- Dendrogram
- Mind Map
- Org Chart
- Sunburst Chart
- Tree Diagram

### Geospatial Charts
Plot data on geographic maps. Components include map projections, markers, and geographic boundaries.

- Bubble Map
- Cartogram
- Chart on Map
- Choropleth Map
- Flow Map
- Hexbin Map
- Isopleth Map

### Tables and Matrices
Display data in a grid format. Components include rows, columns, and cells.

- Matrix
- Table
- Heatmap

### Temporal Charts

Emphasize temporal data with a focus on time axes, events, and durations.

- Calendar
- Gantt Chart
- Timeline
- Timetable

### 3D Charts
Incorporate three-dimensional visuals. Components include depth (Z-axis) and 3D rendering.

- 3D Bar Chart (also in Cartesian Charts)
- 3D Pie Chart (also in Polar Charts)
- 3D Bubble/Scatter Chart (also in Cartesian Charts)
- 3D Surface Plot

### Single-Value Charts and Indicators
Display single data values or key performance indicators. Components focus on numeric displays without axes.

- Card
- Gauge
- KPI

### Proportional Areas Charts
Use the area of shapes to represent data values. Components include proportionally sized shapes like circles or squares.

- Bubble/Scatter Chart (also in Cartesian Charts)
- Circle Packing
- Dot Matrix Chart
- Pictogram Chart
- Proportional Area Chart
- Pyramid Chart
- Treemap
- Waffle Chart

### Decorative and Infographic Elements
Enhance visual storytelling and presentation. May not follow standard chart components.

- Decorative Element
- Infographic
- Illustration Diagram
- Narrative
- Venn Diagram
- Word Cloud

### Filters
Provide interactive filtering capabilities for other visuals. Components include slicers, dropdowns, and buttons.

- Control Filter
- Date Filter
- List Filter
- Text Filter

### Other

- Risk Matrix
- Visual Builder
- Other

## Categories

Categories are secondary classifications that provide additional context for the visual and should help understand the intended use case and target audience.

- Change over Time
- Comparison
- Concepts
- Correlation
- Distribution
- Filters
- Flow
- Hierarchy
- Infographics
- KPI
- Maps
- Narratives
- Part-to-Whole
