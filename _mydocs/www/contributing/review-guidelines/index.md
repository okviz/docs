These editorial guidelines ensure that reviews of Power BI visuals we publish on OKVIZ are consistent, high-quality, and provide unbiased information to help both end-users and developers make informed decisions.

## Mission and Values

Your goal is to provide clear, detailed, and objective reviews of Power BI visuals, based on actual usage and testing, without the influence of pricing or licensing models.

Your core values are:

- **Honesty:** Provide honest assessments based on real-world testing, free from external influence.
- **Objectivity:** Focus on the features and performance of the visual without regard to pricing or licensing.
- **Transparency:** Clearly explain the features, strengths, and weaknesses of the visual without bias.

## Review Structure
Each review must be structured into the following sections:

1. **Overview**  

   Provide an overview of the visual and its general purpose within Power BI. This section could include a brief history of the visual, its developer, and any notable achievements or awards. Also it could include part of final consideration.

2. **Adherence to Visual Type(s)**  

   Assess how well the visual adheres to the standard features of its visual types. See a list of visual types in the [Classification page](classification.md).

3. **Core Features**  

   Provide a free-form discussion of the specific features that make the visual unique. Highlight any standout functionality or customization options that set it apart.

4. **Performance**  

   Evaluate the visual’s performance in terms of speed, responsiveness, and stability. See the performance section in the [Rating System](rating-system.md#design) for more details.

5. **Final Consideration**  

   Summarize the overall performance of the visual. Discuss the rating (see below) and provide a detailed explanation of why the visual received that score based on its features and usability.

6. **Pros and Cons**  

   A "Pros and Cons" section is automatically generated based on your rating (see below), so **do not include it in the content.**

## Rating

Each review must include a rating based on the following criteria:

- **Features:** Assesses the range and functionality of the visual.

- **Design:** Evaluates the visual’s overall design, including its appearance, usability, and how seamlessly it integrates into Power BI. This also includes the performance of the visual with large datasets.

- **Support:** Considers the quality of documentation, user guides, help resources, and vendor responsiveness.

**You do not need to provide the rating**, but you must complete a checklist that will be used to automatically calculate it.

See [Rating System](rating-system.md) for more information.

## Content Guidelines

Please refer to the **OKVIZ Content Guidelines** for shared principles, including:

- **Videos:** If you include a video (which is optional), ensure it focuses solely on the visual and its usage within Power BI. 
- **Comparisons:** Do not compare the visual to other custom visuals. Such comparisons will be addressed in [separate content pieces](../comparison-guidelines.md). But you can compare it to built-in visuals in Power BI, if applicable.

      ```

      ```

   - **Review Description**  

      Provide a brief description of the review content, summarizing the key insights and findings from the review. E.g.:

      analysis in Power BI through its advanced customization options, 
      including flexible axis scaling, dynamic styling, and rich

      fine-tuning your report’s aesthetics, this visual provides the tools 
      you need to create polished and highly informative line charts 
      tailored to your analytical needs.
      ```
