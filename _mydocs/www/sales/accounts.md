When you purchase a license, you can choose to assign it to someone else by specifying a licensee. In this case, two accounts will be created at the [OKVIZ website](https://okviz.com/), one for the billing contact and one for the licensee.

When creating your initial order on the checkout page, you will be entering an email address for the billing contact, and optionally, an email address for the licensee. Each email address is the handle that will be needed to access each account. 

## Billing Account

The email address provided on the checkout page for the billing contact will be the handle needed to access the account that has to do with **billing**. Inside that account, the billing contact will find invoices, renewal instructions, ways to upgrade the coverage, ways to change the payment method if possible, etc. 

We strongly recommend that account is shared within  a team, so that renewal emails or reminders that a credit card is about to expire do not fall through to cracks if someone is on vacation or leaves your organization. This means that the email address may need to be changed at some point, from the email address of one person to the email address of an accounts payable team for example.

## Licensee Account

The email address provided on the checkout page for the licensee will be the handle needed to access the account created for the **licensee**. Namely, that's where the licensee will need to go to download older or newer versions of the visual. The licensee should also rely on this account to download the latest version of the visual whenever they experience any bugs, as this often does the trick and makes you fully independent from our business hours.

## Reseller Account

If you are a reseller, please put your organization's information in the fields that have to do with Billing, and the end user's information in the Licensee field. This will separate the two roles, as each will have their separate account.

> Please note that we do not provide any reseller program, as specified here: [No Resellers Programs](./no-resellers-programs.md)
