At OKVIZ we maximize the efficiency by automating all the processes we can, trying to remove any unnecessary bureaucracy. We try to reflect this efficiency in the pricing of our products, which we try to keep as low as possible to reflect the value of the products and making sure that most of the money goes to the development of the products and not to the sales process.

We believe in the maximum transparency, so **we do not have any resellers programs**. We do not have resellers discounts, and we do not provide a different way to order our products other than our website.

We know that there are companies that prefer to purchase through resellers, and we have made it possible for the resellers to purchase a license on behalf of a customer. However, based on our experience, a customer who purchases through a reseller will face the following issues:

1. **Higher Prices**: Customers who purchase through resellers will typically pay a higher price than if they purchase directly from our website. This is because resellers need to make a profit, and they will charge a fee for their services.

2. **Latency**: You can purchase a license on our websites in a few minutes, but if you purchase through a reseller, you will have to wait for the reseller to process the order and complete the payment, because the license is not released until the payment is completed. This can take several days, and in some cases, even weeks or months.

3. **Renewal Issues**: Usually, resellers do not automatically renew the license. Therefore, the reseller disables the automatic renewal and waits for a purchase order from the customer. Oftentimes, the reseller asks for a new quote at every billing cycle, even if the pricing is always available on our website. When this process goes beyond the expiration date of a license, the customer has reports that do not work correctly, showing a license expired message to the users.

We believe that these issues can be avoided by purchasing directly from our website. When you purchase directly from us, you can be sure that you are getting the best price and the fastest delivery time.
If you have to work through a reseller for company policies or any other reasons, we suggest to consider the 3-year billing period instead of the yearly renewal, so that you lower the friction of the process.
