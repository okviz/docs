At OKVIZ we maximize our efficiency by automating all the processes we can, thus trying to remove any unnecessary bureaucracy. We try to push these savings over into the pricing of our products, which we are committed to keeping as low as possible to reflect the value of the products and to ensure that most of the revenue goes to the development of the products and not to the sales process.

We believe in maximum transparency, so **we do not have any resellers programs**. We do not have resellers discounts, and we do not provide a different way to order our products other than our website.

## Common Issues with Resellers

We know that there are companies that prefer to purchase through resellers, and we have made it possible for the resellers to purchase a license on behalf of a customer (please see the Accounts section). However, based on our experience, a customer who purchases through a reseller will face the following issues:

1. **Higher Prices**: Customers who purchase through resellers will typically pay a higher price than if they purchased directly from our website. This is because resellers need to make a profit, and they will charge a fee for their services.

2. **Latency**: You can purchase a license on our websites in a few minutes, but if you purchase through a reseller, you will have to wait for the reseller to process the order and complete the payment, because the license is not released until the payment is completed. This can take several days, and in some cases, even weeks or months.

3. **Renewal Issues**: Usually, resellers do not automatically renew the license. Therefore, the reseller disables the automatic renewal and waits for a purchase order from the customer. Oftentimes, the reseller asks for a new quote for every new billing cycle, although our pricing is publicly available on our website. When this process goes beyond the expiration date of a license, the customer experiences a disruption in service because the license is close to expiring. Users will start seeing a "license expired" message in their reports. 

4. **Bureaucracy**: Resellers have proven to us over and over that they lack the understanding of what the end user is trying to achieve. This can translate into lengthy exchanges with the OKVIZ team, refusals to study our documentation, and eventually the realization that they simply cannot purchase for you (for example, because they cannot use credit cards). Resellers will also sometimes place and order, pay it, and then cancel it because they have not read our documentation and therefore, they sourced the wrong product. This represents a significant waste for us as it goes outside the scope of a fully-automated, cost-efficient sales process - when precisely, we have automated everything in order to keep the cost of our visuals low.

We believe that these issues can be avoided by having the team that actually knows what they're wanting to achieve, purchase directly from our website. When you purchase directly from us, you can be sure that you are getting the best price and the fastest delivery time.
If you have to work through a reseller for company policies or any other reasons, we suggest to consider the 3-year billing period instead of the yearly renewal, so that you lower the friction of the process.
