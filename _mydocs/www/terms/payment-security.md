Here you will find the payment conditions and security measures that we have in place at OKVIZ Corp.

## 1. Payment Security

- We do not collect any payment information (such as credit card information) on our servers.
- OKVIZ Corp. is PCI compliant.
- Instant payments are processed securely via Stripe.

## 2. Payment Conditions

- Wire Transfers are validated by our system upon receipt of the funds on our bank account. Access to and confirmation of the products and services you purchase is dependent on the funds having cleared.

- For purchases made during time-limited offers such as Black Friday or Cyber Monday, the funds must be sent to OKVIZ before the expiry of our promotional offer - whether by Credit Card or Wire Transfer. Payment terms that postpone the payment to a date later than the expiry of our offer will effectively void the order.

## 3. Contact Information
Contact us at [backoffice@okviz.com](mailto:backoffice@okviz.com?subject=Payment%20Security) for questions related to payments and security.
