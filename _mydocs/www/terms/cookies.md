This document explains the technologies used by this Application to achieve the purposes described below. These technologies allow the Owner to access and store information (for example, by using a Cookie) or use resources (for example, by running a script) on your device while you interact with this Application.

For simplicity, we refer to all these technologies as **"Trackers"** throughout this document—unless there is a need to distinguish them. For instance, although Cookies work on both web and mobile browsers, they are browser-based and do not apply to native mobile apps. Therefore, we use the term *Cookies* only when we specifically mean that type of Tracker.

Depending on applicable law, some purposes for which Trackers are used may require your consent. If you provide consent, you can withdraw it at any time by following the instructions outlined in this document.

This Application uses both Trackers managed directly by us (so-called **first-party Trackers**) and Trackers provided by third parties (so-called **third-party Trackers**). Unless noted otherwise, third-party providers may access the Trackers they manage. The validity and expiration periods for Cookies and similar Trackers vary based on the lifetime settings established by us or the respective provider. Some Trackers expire at the end of your browsing session. For more detailed or updated information about Tracker lifetimes—and details on additional Trackers—please review the linked privacy policies of the respective third-party providers or contact the Owner.
