## 1. Subscription Cancellation

You have a right to cancel your Subscription (i.e., turn off auto-renewals for the upcoming Service period) at any time (please note that canceled Subscriptions will not be refunded for the unused part of the ongoing Service period). Your possibilities to cancel the Subscription and/or get a refund may differ depending on whether you purchased Services from (or are billed through) OKVIZ or a third party (e.g., service provider, retailer).

## 2. Refund
We seek your full satisfaction with our Services. However, if you are not satisfied with our Services, you may cancel the Subscription and request a refund within fourteen (14) days following your purchase of our Services (“Money Back Guarantee”). Please note that we do not grant Money Back Guarantee for the auto-renewed Subscription if you cancel the Subscription after the day of charge for such auto-renewal, unless applicable law provides otherwise. In any case, we would be glad to troubleshoot an issue you experienced before you decide to request a Money Back Guarantee.

## 3. Payment of Refund
Your request will be processed without any unreasonable delay and the refund will be paid using the same payment method as the one used for the purchase, except as otherwise mutually agreed, unless applicable law prohibits us or payment service providers we rely on from processing the refund. For payments made in cryptocurrency, the refund will be made in the same cryptocurrency or in another cryptocurrency if the one used for the purchase becomes unavailable or impracticable to use. The amount to be refunded in cryptocurrency will be calculated based on the equivalent of the price paid in USD at the time of purchase. Once the refund is issued to you, you will lose access to the Services for which you were refunded.

## 4. Eligibility for Refund
You can only get a refund for each of our Services under the Money Back Guarantee twice. If you buy a particular Service again after the second refund for such Service, you will not be granted a Money Back Guarantee for any of its further cancellation. In case you cancel your Subscription at any time after the expiration of the respective Money Back Guarantee period, you shall be charged for the whole Subscription's duration (e.g., if you purchase an annual Subscription and you decide to cancel your Subscription after two (2) months, you will be charged the whole price, but once Subscription has ended, it will not be renewed).

## 5. Subscriptions Purchased via other Providers
The refunds for purchases made from third party marketplaces, retailers, and resellers (e.g. Microsoft AppSource) are handled according to the terms of service of the providers from which the Services were purchased. Cancellation of such Subscriptions may also be subject to the terms of certain providers.

## 6. Canceling the Auto-Renewal of the Subscription Purchased on our Websites
If you have purchased an automatically renewing Subscription on our Websites and would like to stop it from automatically renewing, you can do so at any time by contacting us. Canceled Subscriptions will not be refunded for the unused part of the ongoing Service period.
