Subject to the foregoing sentence, OKVIZ may furnish that portion (and only that portion) of the Confidential Information that it is legally compelled or otherwise legally required to disclose.

## 7. Licensing Terms 

**7.1 Overview**<br>
All Power BI custom visuals provided by OKVIZ are governed by a unified licensing structure. This structure applies uniformly across all visuals and covers licensing on a per-user, per-capacity, or per-site (embedded) basis. 

**7.2 License Types and Definitions**<br>
OKVIZ offers three license types: user-based, capacity-based, and embedded. A “user” is defined as any individual who accesses a report containing a custom visual, without distinction between developer and viewer roles. 

**7.3 User Licensing**<br>
User licensing for OKVIZ custom visuals requires selecting a tier that accommodates the maximum number of users accessing reports with the visual. 

For example, if an organization has 183 users needing access across all reports, the selected tier must have a maximum capacity of at least 183 users. In this case, the 101–200 tier can be used (since its maximum is 200), whereas the 50–100 tier cannot be used (as its maximum of 100 is insufficient). 

Similarly, if an organization has 183 employees but only 78 users access the workspace where the custom visual is published, the tier must cover at least 78 users. Here, the 50–100 tier is suitable (with a maximum of 100 users), while the 21–50 tier is not (with a maximum of only 50 users). 

**7.4 Capacity Licensing**<br>
Capacity licensing applies to workspaces where reports using custom visuals are hosted on capacities that have been licensed. When capacity licensing is used, individual user licenses are not required, provided that all reports are published exclusively in workspaces backed by the licensed capacities. Each capacity used to support such workspaces must have an appropriate capacity license. 

**7.5 Embedded Licensing**<br>
For scenarios involving Power BI Embedded, licensing is determined on a per-site basis. A “site” is defined as a unique domain URL where an application is made available to external users via a custom application. A single embedded license covers all reports published on the same domain; separate licenses are required for reports hosted on different domains. In these cases, user counts are not applicable due to the reliance on a custom authentication process. 

**7.6 License Optimization and Application**<br>
A custom visual must be licensed only once for a given use case. Organizations should select the licensing configuration—whether user-based, capacity-based, or embedded—that best aligns with their deployment scenario. For organizations that use both Power BI Service and embedded reports, separate licenses must be obtained for each environment. Additionally, reports published via “Publish to Web” do not require a custom visual license, except that internal users accessing such reports must be covered by a valid license. 

**7.7 General Provisions**<br>
It is the licensee’s responsibility to ensure that the chosen licensing model adequately covers all users or sites that may access the reports. The license selection should reflect the most efficient and compliant configuration for the organization’s needs. 

## 8. Evaluation Period

**8.1** In the event that you have licensed the Service for evaluation purposes only, the terms of this paragraph shall apply in addition to all the other terms of this Agreement. Your license to use the Service commences on the creation of an user account and, unless you and OKVIZ agree to a different period, terminates automatically thirty (30) days after the date of creation (the "Evaluation Period"). The service will automatically disable itself at the end of the Evaluation Period. You agree that you will not do anything to circumvent or defeat the restriction mechanism, nor open additional user accounts to circumvent the restriction mechanism. Additional product functionality restrictions may apply during the Evaluation Period.

## 9. Payment, Refunds and Subscription Changes

**9.1** Subscribers with paid subscriptions will provide OKVIZ with a valid credit card, and complete and accurate billing and contact information for payment of the applicable subscription fees. This information includes your legal company name, street address, e-mail address, and name and telephone number of an authorized billing contact or Administrator. You will update this information within thirty (30) days of any change to it. If the contact information you have provided expires, or false or fraudulent, OKVIZ reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Services in addition to any other legal remedies. OKVIZ intends to provide a sixty (60) day grace period for subscriptions that merely expire before taking action to terminate any account.

**9.2** All subscription fees are exclusive of all federal, state, provincial, municipal, V.A.T., or other taxes which Subscribers agree to pay based on where the Subscriber is primarily domiciled. In addition to any fees, the Subscriber may still incur charges incidental to using the Service, for example, charges for Internet access, data roaming, and other data transmission charges.

**9.3** Subscribers with monthly paying subscriptions will be charged upon the expiration of any applicable free trial period. Subscriptions canceled prior to the expiration of any trial period, will not be charged. Monthly Subscribers will thereafter be charged in advance each thirty (30) days. Annual Subscribers will thereafter be charged annually on the anniversary date of the initial subscription charge, any may cancel such annual subscription within thirty (30) days of the initiation or renewal of the annual subscription. Otherwise, all charges are final and non-refundable.

**9.4** No refunds or credits will be issued for partial periods of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for periods unused with an active subscription, including, but not limited to, instances involving the removal of a Subscriber.

**9.5** There are is no separate charge to cancel a subscription, and paying subscriptions which are cancelled successfully pursuant to Section 9 prior to the end of their current billing cycle will not be charged again in the following cycle.

**9.6** The amount charged on the next billing cycle will be automatically updated to reflect any changes to the subscription, including upgrades, downgrades, or the addition or subtraction of users. Subscription changes, including downgrades, may result in loss of access to Content, features, or an increase or reduction in the amount of available capacity for Content provided by the Service.

**9.7** All prices are subject to change upon notice. Such notice may be provided by an e-mail message to the Administrator, via the OKVIZ website, or in the form of an announcement on the Service. OKVIZ has different pricing tiers for certain volume accounts, or for accounts embedded on websites. Please contact OKVIZ at [info@okviz.com](mailto:info@okviz.com) for more information on volume pricing or embedded pricing.

**9.8** Subscriber is responsible for paying all taxes associated with the subscription to the Service. If OKVIZ has the legal obligation to pay or collect taxes for which Subscriber is responsible under this section, the appropriate amount shall be invoiced to and paid by Subscriber, unless Subscriber provides OKVIZ with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority.

**9.9** Any and all payments by or on account of the compensation payable under this Agreement shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any taxes. If the Subscriber is required to deduct or withhold any taxes from such payments, then the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that, after making all required deductions or withholdings, OKVIZ receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.

**9.10** Any payment not received from Subscriber by the due date may accrue, at OKVIZ’s discretion, as late charges at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) of the outstanding balance per month, or at the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, from the date such payment was due until the date paid. Such late charge shall also include, at OKVIZ’s discretion, its reasonable fees to collect such non-payment.

## 10. Cancellation and Termination

**10.1** Administrators are solely responsible for canceling subscriptions. An Administrator may cancel their subscription at any time by accessing the Service and visiting the cancellation site as applicable. For security reasons, cancellations shall only be performed by an Administrator using the account cancellation URL within the Service. Cancellations shall not be accepted by any other means.

**10.2** OKVIZ in its sole discretion has the right to suspend or discontinue providing the Service to any Subscriber without notice for actions that are (a) in material violation of this Agreement and (b) create a Security Emergency.

**10.3** If (a) Authorized Users use the Service to materially violate this Agreement in a way that does not create a Security Emergency; (b) OKVIZ provides Subscriber with commercially reasonable notice of this violation; (c) OKVIZ uses commercially reasonable efforts to discuss and resolve the violation with Subscriber; and (d) despite the foregoing, the violation is not resolved to OKVIZ’s reasonable satisfaction within thirty (30) days of such notice, then OKVIZ reserves the right to suspend access to the Service.

## 11. Limitation of Liability

**11.1** OKVIZ shall not be liable for and Subscriber waives the right to claim any loss, injury, claim, liability or damage of any kind resulting in any way from the Services provided to Subscriber by OKVIZ.

**11.2** EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROHIBITED BY LAW, SUBSCRIBER AGREES THAT THE LIABILITY OF OKVIZ (OR OKVIZ’S THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS OR LICENSORS) ARISING OUT OF ANY CLAIM IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE SERVICE WILL NOT EXCEED: (I) THE TOTAL AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID FOR THE SERVICE PURSUANT TO THE AGREEMENT WITHIN THE SIX MONTH PERIOD BEFORE THE DATE THE CLAIM AROSE; OR (II) IF YOU HAVE NOT PAID FOR THE SERVICE THEN $50.

THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE NOT APPLICABLE TO THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATION SET FORTH IN SECTION 13.2. EACH PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS OF THIS AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THIS ALLOCATION IS REFLECTED IN THE PRICING OFFERED BY OKVIZ TO SUBSCRIBER AND IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE FROM AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.

**11.3** Subscriber will solely be responsible for any damage and/or loss of Content contained in Subscriber’s technology which occurs as a result of Subscriber’s electronic equipment and/or Subscriber’s computer system or any third party system or technology.

OKVIZ DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, BUG-FREE, OR COMPLETELY SECURE.
