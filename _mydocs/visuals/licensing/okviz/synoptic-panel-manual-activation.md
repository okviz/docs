If you use Synoptic Panel from AppSource, you have opted for a [hybrid licensing](../index.md#a-third-option-hybrid-licensing) model which requires manual activation of the OKVIZ license.

## Activation Steps

1. Add the visual to your report from the AppSource marketplace.

2. When prompted, grant the visual access to your Entra token. This authorization is necessary for tenant-level activation.

    >> The Entra token could be disabled in your organization. If you encounter issues with the authorization or you don't see the dialog, please contact your tenant administrator.

3. Click the **Activate License** button in the visual properties to open the license activation dialog.
