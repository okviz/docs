AppSource Licensing is a licensing system that allows users to purchase and manage licenses for Power BI visuals directly from the Microsoft AppSource marketplace and Office 365.

> **NOTE:** OKVIZ supports AppSource Licensing for all its premium visuals along with an alternative system offered directly by OKVIZ. See the [Licensing page](index.md) for more information.

This licensing is based on the number of users who will design or consume reports containing the visual. Each license must be assigned to a user and is valid for a specific period of time.

## Purchase Licenses

Here is an overview of the process required to obtain licenses for an OKVIZ visual:

1. Estimate the number of users who will use the visual and, therefore, the number of licenses required. You can do this simply by **adding up the number of people designing reports containing the visual with who will view them**. For example:

    | Designers  | Viewers  | Licenses Required |
    | ---        | ---      | ---               |
    | 1          | 0        | **1**             |
    | 10         | 40       | **50**            |
    | 10         | 750      | **760**           |

2. Visit the visual page on AppSource (e.g. [Calendar Pro](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-US/product/power-bi-visuals/okvizcorp1634637213047.calendarprobyokviz)) and press the ***Buy now*** button.

## Assign Licenses

After you have purchased one or more licenses, you need to assign them to your users or Active Directory groups.

> Anyone purchasing gets permissions to assign purchased licenses. If you are not the purchaser, you must be a Global, License, or User admin to assign licenses. To use group-based licensing, see [Assign licenses to users by group membership in Azure Active Directory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/users/licensing-admin-center)  
If you purchased the license for yourself or other users, you can still assign it with the following procedure.

Follow these steps to proceed:

1. Sign in to your [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/licenses)

2. On the navigation menu, select ***Billing*** > ***Licenses***.

3. Click on ***Assign License*** and select the users or groups to assign the license to.

4. Press ***Assign*** and you are done.

At this point the users you have selected will be able to use all the features of Calendar Pro.

## Unassign Licenses

You can unassign licenses in the same way you assigned them:

1. Sign in to your [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/licenses).

2. Click on the product license to manage.

3. Select the users or groups you want to unassign the license from and press ***Unassign licenses***.

## Cancel Subscription

You can cancel the subscription from the Microsoft 365 admin page:

1. Sign in to your [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/subscriptions)

2. On the navigation menu, select ***Billing*** > ***Your products***.

3. Find the row related to Calendar Pro by OKVIZ, click on the **ellipsis button**, then choose ***Cancel subscription***.
