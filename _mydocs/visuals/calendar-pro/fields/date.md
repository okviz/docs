The ***Date*** field well is used to bind a date column to the visual. The visual will create a calendar based on the dates in the column.

> If you don't provide a date field, Calendar Pro is still able to create a calendar. In this case, the visual will use the current date as the starting point and will create a calendar for the current year, the previous year, and the next year.
