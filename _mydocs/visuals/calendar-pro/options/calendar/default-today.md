**Default value:** Off

When this option is enabled, the initial period displayed by the visual is forced to contain the current date. For example, if the granularity is *Day* and grouping *Month*, the initial day will be today. When the option is turned off, the initial period is the latest selected one.

> This option works only if the calendar contains the current date.
