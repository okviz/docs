**Default value:** (Auto)

This option defines the time zone to be used for the calendar. When "(Auto)", the system time zone is used. 

This setting is mainly used to determine the user's holidays and current date when displaying by Power BI automation, such as report subscriptions. 

> Note that the offset displayed in the UI list is not accurate, as it does not take Daylight Saving Time (DST) into account.
