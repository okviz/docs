The word **"synoptic"** comes from the Greek synopsis, meaning *"a comprehensive view"* or *"seeing together."*

In scientific and technical contexts, the term synoptic refers to something that presents complex information in a single, unified overview—for example, a synoptic chart in meteorology summarizes pressure, wind, and temperature patterns across large areas at once.

This concept perfectly captures the purpose of Synoptic Panel:
**to provide a clear, visual summary of data, allowing users to see relationships and insights at a glance.**

In short, Synoptic Panel is named after the idea of transforming detailed information into a cohesive visual perspective.
