The Dynamic Links field well allows you to create clickable areas in your SVG map that navigate to specified URLs when clicked.

This field well can accept one measure from your dataset that contains the URLs to be used for the links.

> See how to use Dynamic Links in the [Dynamic Links feature section](../features/dynamic-links.md).
