Selection options for the Synoptic Panel.

## Clear Selection on Map Change

**Default value:** On

When enabled, the visual clears any selection when the map changes. 

> Note this option affects only the selection made on the map, not any filters or highlights applied to the report. 

## Allow Empty Matched Area Selection

**Default value:** On

When enabled, matched areas with no fill are selectable. When disabled, they are not selectable.

## Allow Multi-Select

**Default value:** On

When enabled, users can select multiple areas by holding the Ctrl (or Command on Mac) key while clicking on areas. When disabled, only single area selection is allowed.

## Remember Selection

Default value:** Off

When this option is enabled, the report designer (in Edit mode) can select one or more areas in the current display map and save the report with those selections.
When the report is later opened by report consumers (in Reading view), the previously selected areas are automatically restored and shown as selected.
