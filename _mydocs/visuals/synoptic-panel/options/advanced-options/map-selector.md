These options control the behavior of the ***Map Selector*** field. 

This field enables switching between different maps by bounding a DAX measure, which must be created with a specific syntax. See [Map Selector](../../features/filtering-maps.md#map-selector) for more information.

## Show Maps without Selector

**Default value:** Off

When enabled and there is a map selector field, maps without a selector are shown. If disabled, only maps with a selector are shown.

## Separator

**Default value:** âœ„

Defines the character used to separate the elements in the map selector measure.
