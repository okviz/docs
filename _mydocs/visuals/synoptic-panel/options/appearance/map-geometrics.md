This option allows you to configure the geometrics of the maps.

## Keep Aspect Ratio

**Default value:** On

When enabled, the aspect ratio of the map images is preserved. This means that the map images will not be stretched or squashed to fit the available space.


## Viewbox Scale

**Default**: 100%

Defines the map viewbox scale. Increasing the value will make the map larger and could hide some areas, decreasing it will make the map smaller.
