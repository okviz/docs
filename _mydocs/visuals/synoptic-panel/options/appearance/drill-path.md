**Default value:** On


This option allows you to configure the drill path label. The drill path label shows the path of the drill-down hierarchy in the visual. See the [Drill Mode](../../features/drill-mode.md#the-drill-path) section for more information.


## Show on First Level

**Default value:** Off

Show the drill path label even on the first level. If disabled, the label will only show when drilling down.
