Legend in Synoptic Panel is a powerful feature that provides an intuitive way to display data categories and their corresponding colors or values based on your dataset. The legend is a key component of the visual that helps users understand the data represented on the map. 

## Enabling Legend

To activate the legend:
1.	Navigate to the Visual Options in Power BI.
2.	Locate the [Legend](./../options/legend/index.md) section.
3.	Toggle the switch to enable the legend.

Once enabled, the legend will appear within the visual, and you can begin customizing it. You can also connect a column from your dataset to the [Legend field well](./../fields/legend.md) to display the corresponding values.

## Customizing Legend

In Synoptic Panel, each element of the legend can be customized extensively to match your data visualization needs through a **Legend Editor**. You can open it in two ways:

1. **Using the Edit Icon**: within the visual, you can click on the ***Edit icon*** <img src="images/pencil-icon.png" width="25" class="nomargin"> directly on the legend.
2. **Using the Customize Toggle**: In the [Legend](./../options/legend/index.md) section of the visual options, you can toggle the ***Customize*** switch to open the Legend Editor.

When accessing the **Legend Editor** you gain full control over its elements. Within the dialog, you can:

- ***Reorder Legend Items***: Drag and drop items to rearrange their order in the legend. Reordering elements allow you to keep the the order of the legend items consistent on each hierarchy level. Non-reordered items could be displayed in the order they appear in the dataset on different hierarchy levels.
- ***Select a Display Shape***: Choose from various shapes to represent each legend element, including circle, square, dash, arrow, and more.
- ***Assign Colors***: Customize the color of each legend element to ensure clear differentiation and alignment with your visualâ€™s theme.
- ***Rename Category Labels***: Change the label text for each category to make it more descriptive or contextually appropriate.
- ***Toggle Visibility***: Hide specific elements from being displayed in the legend if they are not needed for the current visualization.

### Layout & Style

Synoptic Panel offers extensive options to customize the layout and style of the legend, ensuring it aligns perfectly with your visual design. Specifically, you can configure:

- ***Positioning and Alignment***: Choose where the legend appears in the visual and its alignment relative to the map.
- ***Number of Items to Display***: Set a cap on the number of elements displayed in the legend to maintain clarity.
- ***Element Size and Icon Dimensions***: Adjust the size of the legend elements and their associated icons for better visibility.
- ***Legend Dimensions and Columns***: Control the overall size of the legend and split it into multiple columns for a more organized presentation.
