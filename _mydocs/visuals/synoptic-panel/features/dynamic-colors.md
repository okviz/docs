Synoptic Panel allows you to change the color of areas dynamically based on the data. This feature is useful when you want to highlight specific areas based on the data values.

This can be done in two ways:

- **Conditional Formatting**: Use the Power BI conditional formatting to change the color of areas based on the data values.

    See more: [Power BI Conditional Formatting](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-conditional-table-formatting)

- **Color Rules**: Use the advanced color rules available in several OKVIZ visuals to change the color of areas based on the data values.

    >> This feature is available only when Power BI conditional formatting cannot be usedâ€”for example, when the visual must perform client-side data aggregation, such as when either [Map URLs](filtering-maps.md#map-urls) or [Legend Field](../fields/legend.md) wells are used.
