There are different exporting concepts in Power BI and Synoptic Panel.

### Exporting Reports to PDF or Power Point file

This is a feature of Power BI that allows you to export your report to a PDF or Power Point file. Unfortunately, **this feature is supported only by Synoptic Panel Lite**, since it's certified by Microsoft. If you try to export a report containing Synoptic Panel to a PDF or Power Point file, you will get a placeholder error where the visual was placed.

You can find out what it means here: [Synoptic Panel Certification](../security/index.md#certification)

### Exporting Maps to SVG or JSON

You can export maps from Synoptic Panel to SVG or JSON files via the [Map Editor](../features/map-editor/index.md), by clicking the **Export** button in the [Header](../features/map-editor/edit-map.md#header) section.
