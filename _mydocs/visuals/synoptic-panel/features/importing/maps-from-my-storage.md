When using the [Map URLs](../filtering-maps.md#map-urls-column), you can provide a dataset column containing the URLs of the maps you want to display. In some cases, you may need to add the URLs of maps saved in [My Storage](../my-storage.md) to this column.

The URLs of maps stored in My Storage are readily available and can be exported as described in the [Export Maps URLs](../my-storage.md#export-maps-urls) section. Once exported, they should be added to your dataset column just like any other URL used in the Map URLs field.
