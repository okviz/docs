Exporting to PDF or Power Point file or attaching to Power BI subscription emails, **is not supported by Smart Filter Pro**.  
If you try to do any of the above with a report containing Smart Filter Pro, you will get a placeholder error where the visual was placed.

This happens because Smart Filter Pro is not certified by Microsoft.  
You can find out what it means and why we didn't apply for certification here: [Smart Filter Pro Certification](../security.md#certification)
