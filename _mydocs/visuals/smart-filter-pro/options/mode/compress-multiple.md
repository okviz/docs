**Default value:** Off

This feature shows a single item in the input box instead of displaying multiple items for every filter applied in the input box. It works in Dropdown mode when two or more items of a field are selected. This displays a shorter compressed description of the field name along with the number of items selected in the input box. The selected items will be highlighted in the dropdown list.

For instance, if you select three items of the field ***Category***, then the input box will display ***Category (3)*** as the description, and the selected items will be visible and highlighted in the dropdown list. 


This feature can be useful if you have limited space, and you can choose to compress the height of the input box by keeping your selected keywords inside the dropdown list.
