**Default value:** On

This option allows you to enable or disable the use of wildcards when the [Matching](search-matching.md) is set to ***Advanced Query*** or ***Interactive*** in Search mode.

When this option is turned on, users can use wildcards in their search queries to perform more flexible searches. If this option is turned off, any wildcards used in the search queries will removed, and no special wildcard functionality will be applied.
