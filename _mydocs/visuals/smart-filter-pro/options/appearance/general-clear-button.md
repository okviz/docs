**Default value:** Off

This option, if enabled, displays a button to clear the contents of all input fields at the same time. This makes more sense when there are multiple fields connected to the visual, and you do not want to click on individual [clear buttons](clear-button.md) in each input box to empty it. This button is visible only when you hover over the visual.
