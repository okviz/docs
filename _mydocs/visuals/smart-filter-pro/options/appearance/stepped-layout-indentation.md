**Default value:** 10

This option is used to choose the value for indentation where the subnodes are indented in a progression underneath the parent node in a hierarchy tree.  

For instance, if you choose this value to be a very low number say 3, then the subcategories in the visual dropdown will be placed almost right under the parent category.
