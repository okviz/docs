**Default value:** All rows

This option allows you to specify how many rows the visual should retrieve. Please note that **retrieving more than 30,000 rows may slow down the entire report**. Leave empty to retrieve (almost) all rows.

> It is not guaranteed to retrieve all the data available in the underlying dataset - in fact, there are some [limits set by Power BI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/visuals/fetch-more-data#considerations-and-limitations) that cannot be exceeded: 
- Dataset total row count is limited to **1,048,576 rows**.
- Memory size is limited to **100 MB**.
