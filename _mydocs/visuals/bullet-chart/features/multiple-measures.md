Each measure connected to the ***Value*** role can be associated with a measure connected to the roles: ***Comparison Value***, ***Target*** and ***Target for Variance***. The ***Value*** field will only accept more than one measure when no column is linked to the ***Category*** field.

The connected measures will be associated according to the order in which they are entered in the respective roles (the first measure in the ***Value*** field well will be connected to the first measure connected to the ***Target*** and/or ***Comparison Value*** and/or ***Target for Variance*** fields, and so on).
