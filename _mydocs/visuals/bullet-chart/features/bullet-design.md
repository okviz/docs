Bullet Chart by OKVIZ, allows you to show and compare different metrics, in a single powerful visual, saving precious space on your reports. 
It can render a single primary measure ([Value](./../fields/value.md)) and compares it to a secondary measure ([Comparison Value](./../fields/comparison-value.md)) and/or multiple other measures ([Targets](./../fields/targets.md)).

To enrich your data-storytelling, measures can be embedded in qualitative performance intervals ([States](./../fields/states.md)), usually shown as different intensities of a single hue. 
To highlight the difference between measure and its target, [variance bars](./variances.md) can be displayed allowing to understand the chart more quickly.

Bullet Chart also allows you to show data labels for all measures and it is highly customizable with many [options](./../options/index.md), allowing to define shapes, colors, spaces, and position for all elements.
