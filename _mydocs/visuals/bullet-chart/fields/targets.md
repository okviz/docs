Targets are different measures with relation to the primary and secondary measures, useful to set goals for the metrics. You can connect multiple measures to the **Targets** field.

Each target marker can have different shape, and color. You can also display the related value label with different position, and style options. Each label, can be styled using the same color as the reference target marker. See all options available at [Targets](./../options/targets/index.md).
