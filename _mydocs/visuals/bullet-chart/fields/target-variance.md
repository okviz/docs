This field can accepts more than one target, however, the way the variance bars are displayed depends on certain conditions. If there is a category connected to the **Category** field, **Target for variance** field will accept just one target.

When instead there is no category in the **Category** field, **Target for variance** accepts multiple targets.

See how [Multiple Measures](./../features/multiple-measures.md) works and how you can change default behavior for **Target for variance** at [Share Target Variance](../options/variances/share.md).
