When a measure or column is connected to this field, a secondary bar is displayed behind the main bar (the one referring to the measure connected to the **Value** field). If a **Category** is connected, the field will only accept one measure, displaying one comparison value bar for each category value.

Or, it can accept more than one connected measure when the **Category** field is not populate.
