**Default Value:** (Don't use)

This option allows you to use the color assigned to target markers (read here [how to change colors for Targets](../targets/color.md) markers) for target label elements.
Here are six possible options to choose from:

- **(Don'use):** markers' color is not used for label elements. In this case, the [Color](color.md) of the text, the [Background Color](background-color.md) and the [Border Color](border-color.md) can be chosen manually.

- **Background:** the background color of the target labels will be the same as the marker. In this case it will be necessary to activate it via the [Background](background.md) option. Text color will be assigned automatically to ensure the best visibility.

- **Border:** the border color of the target labels will be the same as the marker. In this case it will be necessary to activate it via the [Border](border.md) option.

- **Background & Border:** both the background and border colors of the target labels will be the same as the marker. In this case it will be necessary to activate them via the [Background](background.md) and the [Border](border.md) options. Text color will be assigned automatically to ensure the best visibility.
