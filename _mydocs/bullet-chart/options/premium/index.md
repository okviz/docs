**Premium options are marked with the symbol ✦**. 

If a premium option is selected and you don't have a license, a banner in the upper left corner of the visual will show the “Upgrade" button that links to AppSource to purchase a license. Hovering over the "i" icon will show the enabled premium option that triggers the banner.

Even without a premium license, the effects of the selected premium options are still enabled and will be displayed for 60 seconds, then those options will be reset to their default value. 

After 60 seconds, a banner in the bottom side of the visual will show all the selected premium settings that have been reset.
