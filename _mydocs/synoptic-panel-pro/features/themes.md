Power BI Report Themes is a feature that allows you to apply multiple settings to a report at the same time and share them via a single JSON file. Check out this page for more information: [Report Themes with Custom Visuals](../../features/themes.md)

Assuming you are setting up a custom JSON theme file ([as described here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-report-themes#setting-theme-colors)), the customizable properties of Bullet Chart are:

| Property | Theme Color |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [Category Labels Color](../options/category-labels/color.md)      | foreground |
| [Data Labels Color](../options/data-labels/color.md)              | foreground |
| [Data Colors - Matched color](../options/data-colors/index)       | dataColors (first color) |
| [Data Colors - Unmatched color](../options/data-colors/index)     | dataColors (second color) |
| [Data Colors - Unbound color](../options/data-colors/index)       | dataColors (third color) |
| [Legend Color](../options/legend/color.md)                        | foreground |
