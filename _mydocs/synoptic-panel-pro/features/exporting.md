There are different exporting concepts in Power BI and Synoptic Panel Pro.

### Exporting to PDF or Power Point file

This is a feature of Power BI that allows you to export your report to a PDF or Power Point file. Unfortunately, **this feature is not supported** by Synoptic Panel Pro. If you try to export a report containing Synoptic Panel Pro to a PDF or Power Point file, you will get a placeholder error where the visual was placed.

This happens because Synoptic Panel Pro is not certified by Microsoft.  
You can find out what it meand and why we didn't apply for certification here: [Synoptic Panel Pro Certification](../security.md#certification)
