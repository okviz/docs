In this section, you will learn how to install and use Synoptic Panel Pro in a Power BI report. This is a quick guide to get you started; for more detailed information, refer to the [Concepts](../concepts/index) and [Features](../features/index) sections.

## Installation

1. Open a new report on Power BI Desktop or [Power BI Service](https://app.powerbi.com).

2. Import the visual into your report:
    - In case you have purchased a license from AppSource:
        - Import the visual by searching for *"Synoptic Panel Pro"* or *"okviz"* in the AppSource marketplace, as explained in [Import a Power BI visual directly from AppSource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/visuals/import-visual#import-a-power-bi-visual-directly-from-appsource).
        
    - In case you have purchased a license directly from OKVIZ:
        - Import the visual file that you have received by email as explained in [Import a visual file from your local computer into Power BI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/visuals/import-visual#import-a-visual-file-from-your-local-computer-into-power-bi).

    - For beta users:
        - Follow the instructions in the email that you have received from OKVIZ.

3. Drag and drop the visual on the report canvas.

## Load a Map

1. Before you can use the visual, you need to bind at least a column to the ***Category Data*** field role.

2. At this point, you will see a simple grid containing a few records from the field you have just bound. This is a non-fully functional placeholder that will be replaced by the actual map once you have configured it. To proceed, click on the ***+ Add Map*** button.

6. You can choose your map from different locations. For this example, click on ***Browse*** to select an SVG image from your local computer.

    > Don't have a map yet? You can download one from our [Sample Maps on Github](https://github.com/okviz/synoptic-panel-maps).

    
If you want to load a map from a different location, refer to the [Maps Location](../features/maps-location/index.md) section.

## Edit the Map 

7. Once you have selected a map, you can start configuring it if you want. For example, you can adjust the data binding in the [Map Editor](../features/map-editor.md) that will open automatically.
