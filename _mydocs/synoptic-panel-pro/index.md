**Synoptic Panel Pro** is a custom visual for Power BI that allows users to display data dynamically across custom images or maps, which are not restricted to geographic representations. These images, [referred to as maps](./concepts/maps/index), consist of defined areas that can be dynamically highlighted or colored based on the underlying data, providing a visually engaging way to present spatial or structured data directly within Power BI reports.

The first version of Synoptic Panel was released in 2015 as part of the **Power BI Best Visual Contest**, where it won first prize. The Pro version is the latest and most advanced version of the visual, which replace the previous legacy version. This version has been rewritten starting from 2023 from scratch to take advantage of the latest Power BI APIs and to provide a more robust and flexible solution, including new features and improvements.
