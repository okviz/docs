Synoptic Panel supports the advanced color rules available in several OKVIZ visuals. 

>> This feature is available in Synoptic Panel only when the Power BI conditional formatting cannot be used because when the visual is forced to perform some data aggregation on the client, like when the [Map URLs](filtering-maps.md#map-urls) role is used.
