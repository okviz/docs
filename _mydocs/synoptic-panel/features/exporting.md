There are different exporting concepts in Power BI and Synoptic Panel.

### Exporting Reports to PDF or Power Point file

This is a feature of Power BI that allows you to export your report to a PDF or Power Point file. Unfortunately, **this feature is supported only by Synoptic Panel Lite**, since it's certified by Microsoft. If you try to export a report containing Synoptic Panel to a PDF or Power Point file, you will get a placeholder error where the visual was placed.
