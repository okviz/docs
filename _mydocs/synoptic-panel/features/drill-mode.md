The Drill Mode is a feature of Power BI that allows you to navigate through the data hierarchy of a visual. When the Drill Mode is enabled, Power BI provides a set of controls that allow you to drill down or up in the data hierarchy. See more in the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/consumer/end-user-drill).

In Synoptic Panel, Drill Mode offers a unique capability to interact with different maps at once. This feature allows users to start from an overarching map and drill down to more intricate details or switch between various map layers to display different aspects of the bound data. This feature is particularly useful when you have complex data structures or when you want to provide different perspectives on the same map.

> Drill Mode also allows you to circumvent the **30,000 rows limit** of Power BI custom visuals, as you can display different maps at different levels of the data hierarchy, each with a subset of the data.


## How to Enable Drill Mode

Drill Mode can be enabled in Synoptic Panel by adding more than a column to the ***Categories*** data role. In this case, the visual will display only a column at a time, and you can switch between them using the drill controls.

> Note that the Drill Mode is available only if your data satisfies some specific requirements. Refer to [Drill Mode Requirements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/consumer/end-user-drill#drill-mode-requirements) for more information.


## How to Use Drill Mode

When the Drill Mode is enabled, you will see a set of controls in the visual header that allow you to navigate through the data hierarchy.

- **Drill up**: Click on the first button to move to the previous level of the data hierarchy. This action will display the previous column in the ***Categories*** data role. If you are already at the top level, this button will be disabled.

- **Drill down one field**: Click on the second button activate the drill down mode. You can then click on a map area to move to the next level of the data hierarchy, but limited to the data point bound to the clicked area. 

- **Drill down all fields at once**: Click on the third button to drill down all the fields of the category column. **This feature is not supported** by Synoptic Panel.

- **Expand fields**: Click on the fourth button to adds another hierarchy level to the current view. This feature is useful to display more detailed maps when a large number of data points. **Use this feature with caution, as it can lead to performance issues.**

Learn more on the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/consumer/end-user-drill).


## How to Setup Maps on Different Levels

When you enable Drill Mode, you can assign different maps to each level in the hierarchy. 

To do this, simply go down to the desired level and import the maps. The visual will remember the maps for that level and display them when you navigate there.

Unfortunately, due to the way Power BI works, there is no other way to assign maps to different levels. The only exception is when you [import multiple maps](importing.md) at once using a configuration file. In this case, you can assign maps to different levels by providing the **Drill Path**, but it is a more advanced feature that requires some knowledge of the path structure (see below).

## The Drill Path

The Drill Path is a representation of the current level in the data hierarchy of the visual. It is used to determine which map to display when you navigate to a specific level.

**Each Drill Path equals a map**.

<img src="images/drill-path-toolbar.png" width="200">

The current Drill Path is visible in the visual header (if not disabled), and knowing how it is built is important to understand why in some cases the visual displays a different map than expected.

Here is how the Drill Path is built:
- **For each level of the hierarchy, except the last one:**
    - If there are **multiple values** in the dataset at that level, the name of the column, as defined in the dataset, is included.
    - If there is **only one value**, the value of the data point is included. For example, if you drill down on a single data point, the path will include its value.

- **For the last level of the hierarchy:**
    - If the **Last-Single** rule (see below) is enabled, the behavior is the same as above.
    - Otherwise, the name of the column, as defined in the dataset, is included.

> Note that renaming the columns in the visual data bucket wonâ€™t affect the path.

### The "Last-Single" Rule

Synoptic Panel offers an advanced option called [Last-Single Rule](../options/advanced-settings/last-single.md).

When enabled, if the dataset at the last level contains only one value, the last element of the Drill Path will be that value. Since maps are assigned on a single Drill Path, you can use this option to associate specific maps to individual values and switch between them by applying single-value filters to the visual. When the option is disabled, the last level of the path is always the name of the column, regardless of the filters applied.

<todo>Example</todo>

>> Be aware that changing the Last-Single setting could make some maps not reachable anymore, as the Drill Path will be different. In this case, you can always manage the assigned maps through the [Maps Manager](../features/maps-manager.md).

### Examples

Consider the following dataset:

|Category|Sector|Seat       |
|--------|------|-----------|
|Economy |210   |SPH00847   |
|Economy |210   |SPH00843   |
|Regular |404   |SPH05186   |
|Regular |304   |SPH04540   |
|Best    |306   |SPH09053   |
|...     |...   |...        |

The Drill Path will be different depending on the actions you perform:

|Action                                             |Drill Path                                 |
|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
|Drill down on the **Economy** category;            |`Economy > Sector`                         |
| &nbsp; &nbsp; then drill down on the **210** sector,      |`Economy > 210 > Seat`             |
| &nbsp; &nbsp; or expand the fields;               |`Economy > Sector > Seat`                  |
| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then apply a single filter on **210**;|`Economy > 210 > Seat`|
| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then apply a filter on **SPH00847**,|`Economy > 210 > Seat`|
| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or apply a filter on **SPH00847** with **Last-Single**.|`Economy > 210 > SPH00847`|
|Expand fields for a single level;                  |`Category > Sector`                        |
| &nbsp; &nbsp; then drill down on the **404** sector.|`Regular > 404 > Seat`                   |
|Expand all fields from the top.                    |`Category > Sector > Seat`                 |
