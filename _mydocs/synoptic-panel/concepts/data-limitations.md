<todo visible>
This page will describe the limitations of Synoptic Panel, including the maximum number of recommended local maps. It will also explain the concept of splitting complex maps into sub-areas and using the drill mode to navigate between them, as well as the need of using remote maps or maps on My Storage, since resources for custom visuals are limited.
