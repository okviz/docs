**Default value:** On

When this option is enabled, you can move to the next page of the visual, as proper a button becomes available.

We consider a page to be the current layout of the visual. If, for example, the visual cover a 12-month period and the current layout shows only 2 months at the same time, we know that there are 6 different pages. The buttons allow you to go to the next page and the previous page.
