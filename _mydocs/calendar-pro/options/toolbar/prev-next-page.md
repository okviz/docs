When the **Prev/Next page** toggle is **On**, you can move to the next page of the visual, as proper a button becomes available.

This option allows you to move "in pairs" with the [columns](../../options/appearance/columns.md) of the [layout](./layout.md). For example, if your layout has two columns, by clicking on **Next page** in the toolbar, the visual will move by two columns.

**Default value:** On.
