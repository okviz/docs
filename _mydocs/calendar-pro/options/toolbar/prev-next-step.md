**Default value:** Off

When this option is enabled, you can move the visual of one step, as proper a button becomes available.

We consider a step to be a single element of current layout of the visual. If, for example, the visual covers a 12-month period, displays 3 months at the same time, and we are at the first month, we know that there are 8 different steps on the right.
