**Default value:** {% include color value="#FD625E" %} (Chart Mode) / random for each field (Calendar Mode)

This option allows you to assign different colors to different events in the case you have set **Off** the **Single color** option.

> **NOTE**: This option is not controllable through a [Report Theme](../../features/themes.md).
