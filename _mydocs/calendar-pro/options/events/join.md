The **Join adjacent events** toggle allows you to manage events that span across multiple days. When it is set to **On**, if the same event spans across different days, it will be displayed as a single event. 

**Default value:** On

These examples show an event (the delivery date) with joined (first) and not joined (second) events:

<img src="images/event-not-joined.png" width="600" alt="A not joined event in Calendar pro">


> **NOTE**: This can be applied only to events when the start or end times are not defined.
