The **Leap rule** option allows you to manage how the leap year will be displayed in the [calendar systems](./system.md) **weekly 4-4-5**, **weekly 4-5-4**, **weekly 5-4-4**.

You can choose between:
- **Symmetry 454**. This will append the leap week to display simmetry in the visual, for the **weekly 4-5-4** case.
- **Custom rule**. You can choose your custome rule by setting the [Append to week](./leap-append.md), [Every X years](./leap-year.md), [starting from](./leap-start.md)  options.

**Default value:** Symmetry454
