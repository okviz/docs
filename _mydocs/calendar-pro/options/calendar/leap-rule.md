**Default value:** Symmetry454

The **Leap rule** option allows you to manage how the leap year will be displayed in the [Weekly calendars](../../features/calendar-systems.md#weekly-calendar-4-4-5-4-5-4-5-4-4).

> The leap year is a year that has one additional day added to keep the calendar year synchronized with the astronomical year or seasonal year. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year)

You can choose between:
- **Symmetry454** - This is a [common rule to manage the leap year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry454).
- **Custom rule** - You can choose your custom rule by setting additional options.
