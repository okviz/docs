**Default value:** 8

This option manages the maximum number of items that the tooltips will display in the visual.

For example, if you set it to 1, and you have one measure in the **Value** field role and one in the **Tooltips** field role, it will display only the **Value** measure.

Set it to 0 or leave it blank to make it display everything.
