When the **Allow all the granularities** toggle is on, all the granularities can be managed in the visual.

When the toggle is off, you can choose which granularity to show in the visual among the proposed ones.

**Default value:** On.

Learn more about how this works in the [Granularities](../../features/granularities.md) section.
