When the **Allow all the granularities** toggle is on (which is the **Default value**), all the granularities can be managed in the visual.

When the toggle is off, you can choose which granularity to show in the visual among the proposed ones.

Learn more about how this works in the [Granularities](../../features/granularities.md) section
