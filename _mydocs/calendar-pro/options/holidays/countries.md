**Default value:** *Automatic* (based on current [localization](../localization/index.md))

This option allows you to choose up to three countries to show holidays for.

## Using the "Holidays Country" field
To set the countries, you can also bind one or more measures to the [Holidays Country](../../fields/holidays-countries.md) data role.

The measure bound there must contain the ISO of the countries you want the holidays to be shown.

When you use this method, the countries set in the **Countries** options are ignored.
