The **Aggregate values** option defines how data is aggregated in Calendar Pro.

Since Calendar Pro provides the ability to [change the granulaity](../../features/granularities.md) of the displayed date periods, the undelying data is aggregated accordinly on the client-side. Thsi aggregation may differ from the data aggregation made by Power BI. For this reason, you can choose how to aggregate the data in the visual:

- **Sum** - This sums the values within the selected granularity.
- **Average** - This calculates the average of the values the selected granularity.
- **First** - This considers the first values within the selected granularity.
- **Last** - This considers the last values within the selected granularity.
- **Maximum** - This calculates the maximum of the values within the selected granularity.
- **Mimimum** - This calculates the minimum of the values within the selected granularity.
- **Count** - This counts the total number of values in the selected granularity.
