**Default value:** Sum

The **Aggregate values** option defines how data is aggregated in Calendar Pro.

Since Calendar Pro provides the ability to [change the granularity](../../features/granularities.md) of the displayed date periods, the underlying data is aggregated accordingly on the client-side. This aggregation may differ from the data aggregation made by Power BI. For this reason, you can choose how to aggregate the data in the visual:

- **Sum**: This sums the values within the selected granularity.
- **Average**: This calculates the average of the values the selected granularity.
- **First**: This considers the first values within the selected granularity.
- **Last**: This considers the last values within the selected granularity.
- **Maximum**: This calculates the maximum of the values within the selected granularity.
- **Minimum**: This calculates the minimum of the values within the selected granularity.
- **Count**: This counts the total number of values in the selected granularity.
