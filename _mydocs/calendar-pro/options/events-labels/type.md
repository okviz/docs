**Default value:** Label

This option allows you to display events and holidays labels in different ways:

- **Label**: By selecting this option, events or holidays will be displayed as labels reporting all the details.

- **Counter**: By selecting this option, events or holidays will be displayed as a counter each day. In other words, the visual will display the total number of events or holidays in the displayed period (according to the underlying [granularity](../../features/granularities.md).

- **Badge**: By selecting this option, holidays or events will be displayed as a badge per each period, regardless of the number of events or holidays.
