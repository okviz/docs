- **Label**. By selecting this option, events or holidays will be displayed as labels reporting all the details.
- **Counter**. By selecting this option, events or holidays will be displayed as a counter each day. In other words, the visual will display the total number of events or holidays per day.
- **Badge**. By selecting this option, holidays or events will be displayed as a badge per each day. Note that if in one day there are more than one holiday or event, the badge type does not allow you to realize it.
