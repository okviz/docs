The **Badge size** option defines the size of the badge that represents holidays or events. 

<img src="images/badges.png" width="600" alt="A joined event in Calendar pro">

This option is visible only if the [type](./type.md) is **Badge** and the [Auto sixe](./badge-auto-size.md) toggle is **Off**.

**Default value:** 5px

>**NOTE**: The proposed image uses also the [legend](../../options/legend/) option.
