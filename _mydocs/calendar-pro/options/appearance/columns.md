**Default value:** 2

This option defines the number of groups per column displayed by the visual.

This option can also be managed into the visual by using the **Change Layout** button:

<img src="images/columns.png" width="700" alt="Columns changing in Calendar pro">

In this case, two columns have been selected so the visual displays two months in two different columns.
