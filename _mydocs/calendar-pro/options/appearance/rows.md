**Default value:** 1

This option defines the number of groups per row displayed by the visual.

This parameter can also be managed into the visual by using the **Change Layout** button:

<img src="images/rows.png" width="700" alt="Columns changing in Calendar pro">

In this case, two rows have been selected so the visual displays two months in two different rows.
