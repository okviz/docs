Power BI Report Themes is a feature that allows you to apply multiple settings to a report at the same time and share them via a single JSON file. Check out this page for more information: [Report Themes with Custom Visuals](../../features/themes.md)

Assuming you are setting up a custom JSON theme file ([as described here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-report-themes#report-theme-json-file-format)), the customizable properties of Calendar Pro are:

| Property | Theme Color |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [Cells border color](../options/cells/border-color.md) | foregroundNeutralDark |
| [Events label border color](../options/events-labels/border-color.md) | foregroundNeutralDark |
| [Group title color](../options/gaxis/color.md) | foregroundNeutralSecondaryAlt |
| [Legend color](../options/legend/color.md) | foreground |
| [Week axis color](../options/waxis/color.md) | foregroundNeutralSecondaryAlt |
| [Weekday axis color](../options/wdaxis/color.md) | foregroundNeutralSecondaryAlt |
| [Year axis color](../options/yaxis/color.md) | foregroundNeutralSecondaryAlt |
