All the elements that show some text (**Cell label**, **Cell value**, **Events/Holidays label**, **Group title**, **Axis: Week**, and **Axis: Weekday**) allow for the possibility to use a:
- Static-sized font.
- Dynamic font that changes its dimensions with respect to the container.

The reference field is **Text size calc mode** and allows you to choose between:
- **Points**. By choosing this option, you can set a fixed value for the text, expressed in points, in the field **Text size**.
- **Percentage**. By choosing this, the text will be displayed as a percentage. In particular, you can choose the maximum and the minimum value that the text can reach (in the options **Min text size** and **Max text size**) and how, in percentage, this must change by selecting the percentage value in the field **Text size**.

Here is an example of how the text responsiveness works:
