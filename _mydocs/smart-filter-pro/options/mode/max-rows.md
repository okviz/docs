**Default value:** 5000

This option allows you to set the number of rows that the visual can retrieve from the dataset. 

<img src="images/max-rows.png" width="700">

Set to 0 to retrieve all the data available to the visual.

> Note that it is not guaranteed to retrieve all the data available in the underlying dataset - in fact, there are some [limits set by Power BI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/visuals/fetch-more-data#considerations-and-limitations) that cannot be exceeded: 
- Dataset total row count is limited to **1,048,576 rows**.
- Memory size is limited to **100 MB**.


## How is performance affected by this setting?

Retrieving more than **30,000 rows** may slow down the entire report, because the Dropdown mode loads all data in memory. If you have a larger column it is recommended to use the [Filter mode](../../features/filter.md).
