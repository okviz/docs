**Default value:** On

This additional option, when enabled, shows a label with the number of hidden items in case you have limited the number of items to be displayed to less than the actual size.

> Note that, for performance reasons, the hidden items count is not calculated accurately if it is greater than 1,000. In this case, a generic string ***+1000*** is displayed.
