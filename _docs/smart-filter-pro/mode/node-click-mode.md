**Default value:** Select/Deselect

This option defines the behavior of your click on the label of the tree nodes when the Smart Filter Pro is in Hierarchy mode.

<todo assign="twinkle">Retake a screenshot with the dropdown expanded</todo>

You can choose among:
- [Select/Deselect](#select/deselect)
- [Expand/Collapse](#expand/collapse)
- [Do Both](#do-both)

> Note that whatever behavior you choose here, you can always expand/collapse by clicking the little arrow next to each node and selecting/deselecting (applying/removing the filter) by clicking its checkbox.

## Select/Deselect

Clicking on a label toggles the selection on the checkbox, by applying the relative filter to the report.

<todo assign="daniele">Take a screencast</todo>

## Expand/Collapse

Clicking on a label expands/collapses the node to which the label belongs.

<todo assign="daniele">Take a screencast</todo>

## Do both

Clicking on a label expands/collapses the node to which the label belongs AND toggles the selection on the checkbox.

<todo assign="daniele">Take a screencast</todo>
