The Dropdown mode in Smart Filter Pro allows you to select items for filtering data by scrolling down a list, or by typing a few keywords and refining your search with an auto-complete list.

## Incremental Loading

The Dropdown mode populates the drop-down list using a tecnique called ***Incremental Loading*** â€“ it doesn't load all data at once, but requests small blocks of values (5000) at a time, completing the list incrementally. This means that, with a large volume of data, this process may take several seconds during which some values are not available for queries.  

> Keep in mind that you can limit the [number of rows to retrieve](max-rows) with a specific option.

> Note that the **Incremental Loading is restarted on each report update** (for example, when changing filters, clicking on any chart/slicer, or changing the active report page), so a large column may slow down the entire report.  

For this reason, the **Dropdown mode is not recommended with fields greater than 30,000 rows**. For larger datasets, the [Filter mode](filter) is better, as it doesn't load values into memory, but just apply filters on demand.
