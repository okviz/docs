***Bookmarks*** is a feature of Power BI that allows you to capture and save the current state of a report page. Smart Filter Pro supports this feature seamlessly.   

To illustrate this option, suppose that you have ***Brand*** and ***Subcategory*** as the input fields in Smart Filter Pro on a particular report page.

Now you want this report page to filter on some specific brands (e.g. ***Contoso***) and subcategories (e.g. some phone-related products) every time you want with a single click. Thus, you can create a bookmark. 
To do so, you first need to display the ***Bookmarks pane***:
- In Power BI Desktop click on the ***View*** ribbon, then select ***Bookmarks***.
- In Power BI Service, click on the ***View*** menu, then enable the ***Bookmarks pane***.

Then you can click on the ***Add*** button and choose a meaningful name.

Even after changing the filters on this page, clicking on a bookmark will automatically change the state of each visual on the page to the state it was at the time you set the bookmark.
