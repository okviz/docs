The Sorting option allows you to choose how to sort the items of the field used for filtering in Smart Filter Pro. It offers two sorting methods to choose from: ***Default***, and ***Custom***. 

## Default Sorting

The ***Default*** method is the one available in every Power BI visual. You click on the visual header ellipsis button and choose a field to sort by in ascending or descending order.

> The default sorting method is described in detail here: [Change how a chart is sorted in a Power BI report (Microsoft)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/consumer/end-user-change-sort)


## Custom Sorting

However, this method doesn't work well with Smart Filter Pro when you have multiple fields or have values, because built-in sorting allows choosing a single field as the sort column. 
Let us say you have 2 fields: ***Category*** and ***Sales***. You want to sort the category in ascending order and the sales in descending order. This is not possible with the default sorting, thus the ***Custom*** sorting method comes in. The custom method allows defining a different sort order for each field.   

This property can be well illustrated by selecting the Observer mode. Suppose you have ***Category*** as the input category field, and ***Sales Amount*** is selected as ***Values***.

Now if you choose the custom sort method, then you will get a list of sort options to choose from:

***Sort ascending***, and ***Sort descending*** will alphabetically sort the categories. Whereas, ***Sort by value ascending***, and ***Sort by value descending*** will sort the categories according to their values â€“ sales metrics in this case.   

For instance, let us say you select ***Sort descending***, then the categories in the input box will be displayed in descending order alphabetically.

If ***Sort by value descending*** is chosen, then the categories in the input box will be displayed in descending order of their sales.

In case there is more than one field in Smart Filter Pro, then the custom sort method allows to choose a different sort order for every field. For instance, suppose you have ***Brand*** and ***Category*** as the input fields, and ***Sales Amount*** is selected as ***Values***. Now if you wish to sort the ***Brand*** field alphabetically in ascending order, and the ***Category*** field by value in ascending order, then you can choose the ***Custom*** sort method, and the required sort order for each field from the field dropdowns.

As you see in the example above, the custom sort method has been chosen, and the field ***Brand*** is sorted alphabetically in ascending order, whereas the field ***Category*** is sorted by value in ascending order.
