Smart Filter Pro uses a proprietary licensing system that follows a subscription-based model. You can choose the license plan that best fits your needs on our website: [Smart Filter Pro pricing](https://okviz.com/smart-filter-pro/#pricing)

After getting a valid subscription with OKVIZ, the Smart Filter Pro license behavior is different based on the way you have load the visual in your reports:

- From a file
- From the AppSource

## From a File

When you activate a subscription and on every renewal, we send you a private version of Smart Filter Pro to your inbox. The same ***.pbiviz*** file is also available in your account dashboard on the OKVIZ website.

You can use this file as any other custom visual files (see [Installation](../get-started/installation.md) for more info), but its peculiarity of this file is that it is unique for you as it contains the your license information encoded in the file itself.


## From the AppSource
