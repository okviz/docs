Smart Filter Pro can work in different modes. Each mode has unique benefits and features.

For example, ***Filter mode*** is useful if you have huge datasets since it doesn't consume all the resources of the other modes and can search on-demand, while the ***Dropdown mode*** loads all underlying data incrementally.

Each mode is explained in detail on the following pages:

- [Dropdown Mode](../options/mode/dropdown.md)
- [Filter Mode](../options/mode/filter.md)
- [Search Mode](../options/mode/search.md)
- [Observer Mode](../options/mode/observer.md)
- [Hierarchy Mode](../options/mode/hierarchy.md)
