Smart Filter Pro allows you to **paste data from other applications such as Microsoft Excel** and is able to recognize and split this data into multiple values based on user-defined options, ignoring values that are not in the underlying dataset and optionally applying the filter to the report.

Find out how it works and configure it here: [Split Pasted Text](../options/mode/split-pasted-text.md)
