Power BI Report Themes is a feature that allows you to apply multiple settings to a report at the same time and share them via a single JSON file. Check out this page for more information: [Report Themes with Custom Visuals](../../features/themes.md)

Assuming you are setting up a custom JSON theme file ([as described here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-report-themes#setting-theme-colors)), the customizable properties of Smart Filter Pro are:

| Property | Theme Color |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [Items back color](../options/appearance/index.md#items-back-color)       | dataColors[0] |
| [Dropdown back color](../options/appearance/index.md#dropdown-back-color) | background |
| [Border color](../options/appearance/index.md#border-color)               | backgroundLight |
| [Labels font color](../options/labels/index.md)                           | foregroundLight |
| [Node text color](../options/appearance/index.md#node-text-color)         | foreground |
