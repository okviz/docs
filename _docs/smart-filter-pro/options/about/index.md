This section contains information about the visual such as the version, licensing details, and options related to telemetry and updates.

### License

License details include the following fields:

-	**Licensee name**: Name of the licensee user
-	**License key**: Alphanumeric key required to unlock the visual
-	**License status**: Active/Expired *(read-only)*
-	**Expiration date**: Expiry of the license if not renewed *(read-only)*

Note that licensee name and license key fields may be read-only if you are using Smart Filter Pro from a file - this means that the visual is pre-activated and the license information is hardcoded in the visual itself.

> More information can be found here: [Smart Filter Pro Licensing](../../licensing.md)

#### Other Options:

- [Check for Updates](check-for-updates.md)
- [Send Telemetry](send-telemetry.md)
