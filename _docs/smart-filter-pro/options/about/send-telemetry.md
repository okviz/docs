**Default value:** On

The "Send telemetry" setting, if enabled, sends anonymous data to OKVIZ about the features used in the component. The telemetry data is used to precisely understand which features of Smart Filter Pro are being used - offering better visibility into performance without the need to solicit feedback directly from users. It only sends out anonymous data about the features used and does not send out any personal data from the reports and/or the underlying datasets. However, you may even choose to disable the Telemetry setting in the visual. This setting does not work when you do not have a working Internet connection.
