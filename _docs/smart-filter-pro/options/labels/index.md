The options in this section define the appearance of the placeholders and labels of the visual. 

With placeholder we intend the light text that appears inside the filter input in all modes except Observer. Labels, instead, are visible only when you are in Observer mode or Dropdown mode with horizontal orientation.

For each field connected to the visual, you can choose a specific text that will appear in relevant placeholders/labels.
