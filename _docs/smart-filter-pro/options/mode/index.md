**Default value:** Dropdown

Smart Filter Pro can be used in different modes, each one providing unique benefits and features.

For example, ***Filter mode*** is useful if you have huge datasets since it doesn't consume all the resources of the other modes and can search on-demand, while the ***Dropdown mode*** loads all underlying data incrementally.
