**Default value:** 1

This option allows you to set the number of selected filter items to be displayed in the input box before compressing the field as specified by the [Compress Multiple](compress-multiple.md) option.

For instance, let us say you set this value to 3, so until you select less than or equal to three items for filtering, those three selected items will be displayed in the input box which is the usual behavior.

As soon as you select more than three items for filtering, the field will be compressed and the input box will display a shorter compressed description of the field name along with the number of items selected.
