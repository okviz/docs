**Default value:** Select/Deselect

This option defines the behavior of your click on the label of the tree nodes when the Smart Filter Pro is in Hierarchy mode.

You can choose among:

- **Select/Deselect**  
    Clicking on a label toggles the selection on the checkbox, by applying the relative filter to the report.
- **Expand/Collapse**  
    Clicking on a label expands/collapses the node to which the label belongs.
- **Do both**  
    Clicking on a label expands/collapses the node to which the label belongs AND toggles the selection on the checkbox.

> Whatever behavior you choose here, you can always expand/collapse by clicking the little arrow next to each node and selecting/deselecting (applying/removing the filter) by clicking its checkbox.
