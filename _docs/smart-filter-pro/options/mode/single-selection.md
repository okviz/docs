For instance, let us say you have connected a Brand field to Smart Filter Pro and selected the brand Contoso.

Now if after specifying an item for filter – Contoso in this case, you specify another item, say Proseware, then the results will be filtered as per the latest item specified – Proseware, and you will no longer see the Contoso brand in the input box.
