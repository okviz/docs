To report a bug with OKVIZ visuals, please follow the directions below:

1. Check if your issue already exists in the ***Issues page*** of the visual repository ([see below](#issues-pages)).

2. If you don't find anything relevant, insert a new issue including as much details as possible.

3. Include a sample report (***.pbix*** file) that reproduces the issue. If your report contains private data or you cannot share it publicly for any reason, please recreate it with dummy data. 
If you are not able to upload the sample file to Github, please send it to [support@okviz.com](mailto:support@okviz.com) with a **reference to the issue number**.

> **IMPORTANT**: We cannot guarantee bug fixes without a sample file!

## Diagnostic Data

In some cases, when it is not possible to share reports with us and you are unable to reproduce the problem locally with dummy data, we may ask you to send us visual diagnostic data. **Please note that the data produced by the following procedure may contain sensitive data, so check everything before sharing.**

1. Open your report with Power BI service (https://app.powerbi.com)

2. Open the browser console panel. With Chrome you can just press Ctrl + Shift + J (Cmd + Option + J on Mac);  alternatively, you can use the top right menu in the browser window, select the option ***More Tools***, then ***Developer Tools*** and click the ***Console*** tab.

3. Go to ---TODO
