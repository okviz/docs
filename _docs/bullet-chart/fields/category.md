In this field it is possible to link a column of the dataset representing the data category to be displayed. You can link more related columns or a hierarchy, thus enabling drill-down. When a column is connected to the **Category** field, a measure must be connected to the **Value** field to show the bars (one for each category value).

The **Comparison Value**, **Target** and **Target for Variance** fields, if populated, will also refer to each category value.
