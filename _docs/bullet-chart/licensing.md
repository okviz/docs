Bullet Chart is a free visual but some options require a valid license to be used. We use a licensing system offered by Microsoft based on the number of Power BI users viewing the visual. You can purchase a plan that best suits your tenant capacity directly in AppSource and assign these licenses through your Office 365 admin area.
