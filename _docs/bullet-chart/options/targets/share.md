**Default value:** On

This option is only visible when [multiple measures](./../../features/multiple-measures.md) are bound to the visual and allows you to define whether targets are shared by all measures. If the option is ***Off***, each target is associated only with the measure that is in the same position in the fields panel. In other words, every measure will have only one target - each bar will have only a target marker.
