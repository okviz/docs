**Default value:** On

This option is only visible when multiple measures are bound to the visual (without categories) and allows you to define whether targets are shared by all measures. If the option is ***Off***, each target is associated only with the measure that is in the same position in the fields panel. In other words, every measure will have only one target - each bar will have only a target marker.
