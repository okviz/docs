Variance bars allow to highlight the differences between the current value and a specific target. To display variance bars, a target value needs to be connected to the ***Target for variance*** field.


This field accepts more than one target, however, the way the variance bars are displayed depends on certain conditions. If there is a category connected to the ***Category*** field, the variance target value for all bars will always be the first one connected to the ***Target for variance*** field. When instead there is no category in the ***Category*** field  and there is more than one value connected to the ***Value*** field, the default behavior can be modified. See how at [Share Target Variance](../options/variances/share.md).
