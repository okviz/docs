 Bullet Chart allows you to add different measures when no measure is connected to the **Category** field. A **Target** and a **Comparison Value** can be associated with each measure. The association between measures in the various fields is given by the order in which they are connected (the first measure in the **Value** field will be connected to the first measure connected to the **Target** and/or **Comparison Value** field, and so on).
