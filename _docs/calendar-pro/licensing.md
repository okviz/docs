Calendar Pro requires a valid license to be used. We use a licensing system offered by Microsoft based on the number of Power BI users viewing the visual. You can purchase a plan that best suits your tenant capacity directly in AppSource and assign these licenses through your Office 365 admin area.

If you are using Calendar Pro without a valid license, you will see different notifications based on your environment:

- Power BI Desktop / Power BI service in Edit view
