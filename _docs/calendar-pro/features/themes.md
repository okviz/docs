Power BI Report Themes is a feature that allows you to apply multiple settings to a report at the same time and share them via a single JSON file. Check out this page for more information: [Report Themes with Custom Visuals](../../features/themes.md)

Assuming you are setting up a custom JSON theme file ([as described here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-report-themes#setting-theme-colors)), the customizable properties of Calendar Pro are:

| Property | Theme Color |
| -------- | ----------- |
| <todo>TODO</todo>     | dataColors (first color) |
