Calendar Pro uses the latest tecnologies available and is updated regularly. It does not contain malicious or unsafe code.

## Certification

The [Power BI certification program](../get-started/certification.md) ensures that custom visuals are safe, up-to-date, and reliable.

**Calendar Pro is currently being certified.**


## Data Sent over the Internet

No data is sent over the Internet to external services. The only network communication is between the Power BI core services and the visual, which is required to make it work properly.
