The license for Smart Filter Pro follows a subscription-based model. There are different plans available depending on the type of Power BI license used. 

The licensing of Smart Filter Pro is different when downloaded from the AppSource marketplace and when downloaded from our website. When downloaded from the AppSource marketplace, the user needs to explicitly write the license key every time they add a visual to a report. 

More information about download, installation, and licensing can be found here.

Send Telemetry
The "Send telemetry" setting, if enabled, sends anonymous data to OKVIZ about the features used in the component. The telemetry data is used to precisely understand which features of Smart Filter Pro are being used - offering better visibility into performance without the need to solicit feedback directly from users. It only sends out anonymous data about the features used and does not send out any personal data from the reports and/or the underlying datasets. However, you may even choose to disable the Telemetry setting in the visual. This setting does not work when you do not have a working Internet connection.

Check for Updates
Power BI frequently receives updates and thus, custom visuals must interact with this evolving platform synchronously. Updates might be required not only when a user might be interested in new features, but also to guarantee existing features. Bug fixes and updates required to support new versions of Power BI are the two main reasons why keeping the custom visuals up-to-date is important.
We recommend you read Updating Power BI custom visuals - OKVIZ for more information.


Smart Filter Pro sends out notifications about new versions if the “Check for Updates” setting is enabled. It checks if there is a new version of the visual and displays a message in the Editing view of report. In any case, a notification email about a new version available is sent to the user who registers Smart Filter Pro, including a link for the direct download. Just like Send telemetry setting, this setting will also not work in case you do not have a working Internet connection.

The "Check for updates" setting is beneficial for users who manually download and update the licensed custom visual. While for the users who installed Smart Filter Pro from the Microsoft store, the updates are automatic. The frequency for release of update is no more than 1 per month.
