Welcome to OKVIZ Documentation for Power BI Custom Visuals.

[OKVIZ](https://okviz.com), launched in 2015, was one of the first player in the third-party developer community of Power BI. Since then we produce high quality custom visuals for Power BI, such as **Smart Filter Pro**, **Card with States**, **Synoptic Panel**, and **Bullet Chart**.

This documentation contains an overview of the features common to all OKVIZ visuals and a deeper explanation of the features of premium visuals such as **Smart Filter Pro**.
