<todo assign="twinkle">Explain the different interactive modes we have in Power BI. 
Include a link to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/service-interact-with-a-report-in-editing-view">Microsoft docs</a>. We need this page because our visuals and licensing model behave differently based on the current view mode, so it's worth having an internal reference explaining what these view modes are.</todo>
