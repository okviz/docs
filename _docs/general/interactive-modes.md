There are two [modes for interacting with reports](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/service-interact-with-a-report-in-editing-view) in the Power BI service: ***Reading view*** and ***Editing view***. If you are a business user, then you are more likely to use ***Reading view*** to consume reports created by others. ***Editing view*** is used by report owners and designers, who create the reports and share them with others.   

***Reading view*** is the way to explore and interact with reports created by colleagues. Even in ***Reading view***, the content is not static. The ***Reading view*** even allows you to slice and dice the content, discover interesting insights in data, send you alerts when data changes, and email reports to you on a schedule you set. This can be done for all your data, any time, in the cloud or on-premises, from any device.  

When you open a report, it opens in ***Reading view*** by default. If you have edit permissions, then you see the ***Edit report*** option in the upper-left corner, and you can view the report in ***Editing view***. If a report is in a workspace, everyone with an admin, member, or contributor role can edit it. They have access to all the exploring, designing, building, and sharing capabilities of ***Editing view*** for that report. The people they share the report with can explore and interact with the report in ***Reading view***.  

The filtering capabilities available to you depend on which interactive mode you are in:
- In ***Reading view***, you can interact with any filters that already exist in the report, and save the selections you make. New filters cannot be added.  

- In ***Editing view***, you can add all kinds of filters. When you save the report, the filters are saved with the report, even if report readers open it in a mobile app. People looking at the report in ***Reading view*** interact with the filters you added, but cannot add new filters.
