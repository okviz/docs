To submit an issue with OKVIZ visuals, please follow the directions below.

## Premium Visuals (Smart Filter Pro)

Contact us at [support@okviz.com](mailto:support@okviz.com?subject=Paid%20Visual%20Issue&body=Subscription%20 #:%0D%0ADescription%20of%20the%20problem:%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0ASmart%20Filter%20Pro%20version:%0D%0APower%20BI%20version:%0D%0AScreenshot:%0D%0A%0D%0A%5BDON%27T%20FORGET%20TO%20ATTACH%20A%20SAMPLE%20REPORT%5D) providing this information (all required):
- Your **subscription number**.
- A clear and concise **description of the problem**.
- The **version of the visual** you are using. You can find it the [About & License](../smart-filter-pro/about) section of the visual options.
- The **version of Power BI Desktop** you are using (or the browser you are using with the Power BI service).
- A **screenshot/screencast** of the problem (if applicable). 
    You can record the screen on Windows by using PSR (Steps Recorder). Follow these steps:
    1. Click on the Start menu, then type `PSR`, then click on ***Open Step Recorder***.  
    2. Click on the help icon and choose ***Settings***; here you need to set 100 in the  ***Number of recent screen captures to store*** option.
    3. Press ***Start Record***. 
    4. Record the issue and once this is done, please select ***Stop recording***, save the file somewhere and sent it to us.

- A **sample Power BI report (PBIX file)** that reproduces the problem.  
Note that:
    - If your report contains private data, you should recreate it with dummy data. Or we can sign an NDA document to access the original data.
    - If the issue is related to performance or loads a large amount of data, you should include the data as a separate Excel file.
    - If your report loads the visual from the Organizational Store, you should replace it with a local version, otherwise we will not be able to check the report correctly. You can find a local version of the visual in your [Account](https://okviz.com/account/) section on the OKVIZ website.


## Free Visuals

1. Check if your problem already exists on the [Issues section](https://github.com/okviz/free-visuals/issues)
 on Github.  
 If it exists, check the proposed solution (if any), or add your comments there.

2. If you don't find anything relevant, [Create a new issue](https://github.com/okviz/free-visuals/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug-report.md&title=Visual+Name+-+Issue+description) including as much detail as possible, your version of Power BI Desktop (or the browser you are using with the Power BI service), and the name of the visual.

3. Include a sample Power BI report (PBIX file) that reproduces the problem. 
If your report contains private data or you cannot share it publicly for any reason, please recreate it with dummy data. 
If you are not able to upload the sample file to Github, please send it to [support@okviz.com](mailto:support@okviz.com?subject=Free%20Visual%20Issue%20) with a reference to the issue number.

> IMPORTANT: We will not consider issues without a sample file!

## Microsoft Support

Sometimes the issue you want to report is not related to our code or affects custom visuals from other vendors.  
In such cases, it is best to open a support ticket with Microsoft at this page: [Open a Microsoft Support Ticket](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/support/pro/)
