## How to Use a Custom Visual

The vast collection of Power BI custom visuals can be explored from the [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-US/marketplace/apps?product=power-bi-visuals). These Power BI visuals, basically, are packages that include code for rendering the data served to them. They are packaged as *.pbiviz file*.   

Custom visuals can be downloaded from the Microsoft AppSource and can then be imported into a Power BI report.

### Downloading Custom Visual from Microsoft AppSource    

- Go to the Microsoft AppSource website, and select the ***Apps*** tab from the bar on the top.
